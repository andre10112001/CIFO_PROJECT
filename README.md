# CIFO_PROJECT

In this project, we are solving an Asymmetric Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (ACVRP) using genetic algorithms. We have implemented several variations of solutions by modifying the selection process, mutation, and crossover techniques.

## Problem Description
The Asymmetric Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (ACVRP) involves optimizing the routing of vehicles to deliver goods from a depot to various customers while minimizing costs or maximizing efficiency. Key constraints include vehicle capacity limits and asymmetrical travel costs between locations.

## Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. They use a population of candidate solutions (individuals) that evolve over generations through selection, crossover (recombination), and mutation.

## Genetic Algorithm Schema for Each Solution

### Solution 1
- **Selection Method**: Roulette Wheel Selection
- **Crossover Method**: Single-Point Crossover
- **Mutation Method**: Inversion Mutation (With a slight variation)

### Solution 2
- **TO DO**
### Solution 3
- **TO DO**
### Solution 4
- **TO DO**
